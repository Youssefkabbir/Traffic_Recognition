#                                                         Traffic Signs Recognition
Traffic signs are an integral part of our road infrastructure. They provide critical information, sometimes compelling recommendations, for road users, which in turn requires them to adjust their driving behaviour to make sure they adhere with whatever road regulation currently enforced. Without such useful signs, we would most likely be faced with more accidents, as drivers would not be given critical feedback on how fast they could safely go, or informed about road works, sharp turn, or school crossings ahead
